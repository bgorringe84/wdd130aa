      Hi there! My name is Brandon Gorringe and I am currently pursuing a degree
      in software engineering. For the past year, I have been working as a
      backend programmer in the field. However, my current job has required me
      to work more on full stack development, so I am in need of a refresher in
      web fundamentals. Learning about careers in web design can be extremely
      advantageous for personal and professional growth, as it can help improve
      one's understanding of user experience and interface design. This
      knowledge can be applied to various industries, including tech, marketing,
      and e-commerce, to name a few.
